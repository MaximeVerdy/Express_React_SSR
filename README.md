# Next.js vs Express.js

### Next.js built-in support for SSR

- **Complexity**: Next.js abstracts many SSR details, making it less flexible for customization and troubleshooting.
- **Performance Overhead**: Next.js may introduce additional overhead compared to custom SSR setups, affecting performance in certain scenarios.

### Express React SSR

- **Flexibility**: Express.js allows for fine-grained control over server-side logic, enabling customizations tailored to specific project requirements.
- **Performance Optimization**: With Express.js, developers can optimize SSR performance by fine-tuning server configurations and implementing caching strategies.
- **Simplified Development**: Express.js offers a familiar development experience for Node.js developers, minimizing the learning curve and streamlining the development process.

### Why Choose Express for SSR?

- **Total Control**: Express.js empowers developers to handle SSR intricacies directly, ensuring optimal performance and flexibility.
- **Minimal Overhead**: By avoiding the abstractions introduced by Next.js, Express-based SSR setups can be more lightweight and efficient.
